    Detects TestNG test cases that can be converted to JUnit 5.
</p>
<p>
    This inspection detects <b>all</b> TestNG test cases as sources for migration to JUnit 5.
    In many cases the class cannot be completely converted automatically into a fully functional
    JUnit 5 test case, but the inspection will suggest a quickfix to do the bulk of the changes,
    and leave the final bits and pieces for manual fixing.
</p>
<p>
    The quick fix will convert assertions to JUnit 5 assertions. It will also swap argument
    order of expected & actual arguments, unless AssertJUnit or ArrayAsserts is used.
    Also Before/After-annotations are migrated, but be aware that JUnit 5 essentially requires
    BeforeAll/AfterAll-annotated methods to be static, which they might not be in the original
    TestNG tests.<br/>
    The quick fix will also prepare for removal of inheritance by adding @Transactional annotation
    to the test class if it is present on any super class. Also @ContextConfiguration will be
    replaced with @SpringBootTest if spring-boot-test is available on the class path.
